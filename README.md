Scrape data from Tally.xyz for a specific DAO.
Use AI to summarize several aspects for the proposal

- Logistics: When the proposal was submitted, when it is ready to vote on, when voting ends, the earliest execution time.
- Action: What actions does the proposal take
- Impact: What impact will this have on the protocol and the DAO treasury
- Context: What was discussed in the process (may need to include a reference to a forum post)

## User Story

1. **User Input**: The user enters their wallet address.
2. **Delegate Page Scraping**: The application navigates to the user's delegate page on Tally.xyz.
3. **DAO Membership Identification**: The application scrapes the DAOs the user is a member of.
4. **Database Entity Creation**: An entity for the user is created in the database.
5. **Proposal Scraping**: The application scrapes all proposals from the identified DAOs on the user's Tally page.
6. **Proposal Processing**: The application processes these proposals for each DAO.
7. **Proposal Summary**: The application provides a summary of the proposals to the user.

## Technical Details

### Scraping Process

1. **Setup Firecrawl.dev**:

   - Install Firecrawl.dev by following the installation instructions on their website.
   - Configure Firecrawl.dev with the necessary settings to access Tally.xyz.

2. **Navigate to Delegate Page**:

   - Use Firecrawl.dev to navigate to the user's delegate page on Tally.xyz using the provided wallet address.

3. **Scrape DAO Memberships**:

   - Extract the list of DAOs the user is a member of from the delegate page.
   - Store the DAO information in the database.

4. **Scrape Proposals**:

   - For each DAO, use Firecrawl.dev to navigate to the proposals page.
   - Extract details of each proposal, including submission date, voting dates, actions, and context.

5. **Data Storage**:

   - Store the scraped proposal data in the database, associating it with the respective DAO and user.

6. **Data Processing**:

   - Process the scraped data to generate summaries for logistics, actions, impact, and context.

7. **Summary Generation**:
   - Use AI algorithms to generate a concise summary of each proposal.
   - Present the summary to the user in a user-friendly format.

### Tools and Libraries

- **Firecrawl.dev**: Used for web scraping and navigation.
- **Database**: Used to store user, DAO, and proposal data.
- **AI Algorithms**: Used to generate summaries from the scraped data.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Scraping

1. **Setup Project**:

   - Initialize a new Node.js project.
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., Firecrawl.dev, database libraries).

2. **Firecrawl.dev Configuration**:

   - Configure Firecrawl.dev to access Tally.xyz.
   - Write Node.js scripts to navigate to delegate pages and scrape DAO memberships.

3. **Database Setup**:

   - Design the database schema to store user, DAO, and proposal data.
   - Implement database connection and CRUD operations using Node.js.

4. **Scraping Scripts**:

   - Implement Node.js scripts to scrape delegate data, DAO memberships, and proposals.
   - Store the scraped data in the database.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test the scraping scripts to ensure data is correctly extracted and stored.
   - Validate the data integrity and completeness.

### Phase 2: Data Processing

1. **Data Processing Scripts**:

   - Implement Node.js scripts to process the scraped data.
   - Generate summaries for logistics, actions, impact, and context.

2. **AI Integration**:
   - Integrate AI algorithms to generate concise summaries of proposals.
   - Test the AI-generated summaries for accuracy and relevance.

### Phase 3: User Interface (Future Phase)

1. **Frontend Development**:

   - Design and implement a user-friendly interface to display the proposal summaries.
   - Allow users to input their wallet address and view their delegate data and proposal summaries.

2. **Backend API**:
   - Develop backend APIs to serve the processed data to the frontend.
   - Ensure secure and efficient data retrieval.

### Phase 4: Deployment (Future Phase)

1. **Deployment Setup**:

   - Set up deployment pipelines for both frontend and backend.
   - Deploy the application to a cloud provider.

2. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Implement monitoring tools to track the application's performance.
   - Set up maintenance routines to ensure data accuracy and system reliability.
